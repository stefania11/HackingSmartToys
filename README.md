### Objectives:
Students will also design their own AI toys or construction kits which they will test in local communities (schools, libraries, museum, community centers). Final projects will be displayed in a play exhibition where all communities involved throughout the course will be invited to participate. 

### Description:
Much of our daily life is quietly being reshaped by AI while an entire generation of children is growing up with this technology in their homes. The best way to understand the algorithms that drive AI applications is to make your own -- to write and train them through playful and interactive activities. The Hacking Smart Toys for AI Learning course consists of a series of hands-on activities focused on designing and testing several smart toys, construction kits and play experiences that can support youth to better learn and play with AI. Both beginners and more advanced students are welcome. In this track participants will design with and hack existing smart toys and AI devices to support youth, families and educators to customize and appropriate these technologies in playful ways. The goal of the course is to imagine the future of smart toys and AI devices for youth and to explore the social and ethical conditions of children growing up with AI. The course will introduce students to different aspects of machine learning through play while engaging the local community of toy designers, artists, AI pioneers. The things we will do include writing applications for current smart toys and AI devices like Cozmo and Vector robots, Amazon's Alexa, Lego Wedo bricks. 
### Costs: 
Most of the class materials will be provided by the instructor, students will have to purchase materials for personal final projects and for home prototyping.

### Grading 
Half of the total grade is based on individual work and the other half is based on teamwork. Class and lab participation grades are based on both attendance and quality of in-class activity.

Discussion: Impressions and thoughts on "The Veld" short story
In Class Exercises: We will play with three connected toys(Cozmo, Hello Barbie and Sphero Mini) and then learn how to look behind the curtain and re-engineer them by using their SDKs, Cognimates and other platforms. Students will also learn how to analyze these toys by looking at their form factor, interaction design, play affordances, and many other criteria. We will also discuss co-designing for play and creative learning with youth and what are some of the most successful strategies for learning by playing and by doing. 

Reading Assignments:
* [Characteristics of Boys' and Girls' Toys!](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-005-7729-0) - Judith Blakemore and Renee E. Centers

Production Assignment: Make groups of 2-3 students. Pick a persona (it can be a child or adult) and design an activity in which this person can learn with and about one of the smart toys presented in class. Try to make the activity as interactive, weird and unexpected as possible. Document your activity and make a 1 minute demo video in your design journal. 


#### Week 3: Learn from Toy Designers 
Date: 02.15.2019
Discussion: We will have a toy designer guest who will introduce us through their process and present the toys they built. They will also provide feedback on your home projects in a critique studio session. 
Show: Every group will get 10 minutes to present their home project and then 5 min for questions and feedback. 

Reading Assignment:
* [Naef toy review from a mom!](https://www.aboutamom.com/naef-toy-review/)

Research Assignment: Find a toy that you like (or dislike) and try to see how different stakeholders talk about it: how is it presented by the creators, how are parents and kids talking about it, does the toy match their expectations, do they use it in unusual ways? Analyze the toy you picked from all the different perspectives and discuss also cultural, SES and age differences in the recounts you encounter. Document and present your findings in your design journal. Drawings, collages or any other way to capture and present your conclusions are welcomed. 



#### Week 4: Tinker Toys: Lego, AIY, and Microbit 
Date: 02.22.2019

Discussion: 3 students will be randomly selected to present their findings on the research assignment (5 min each + Q&A)
In Class Exercises: In this week class we will play with more DIY and tinkerable toys and learn how to assemble, program them and make them "smart" by connecting them to other cognitive services like vision or sentiment recognition. Students will then divide into groups, pick some of the parts from different kits and try to combine them in unusual ways. We will also have crafting and prototyping materials for this part of the session. We will end with a play session where we all go around and play with each other creations and provide feedback on each other creations.
